# Specification Quality Checklist: Mass-Spring Oscillation Simulator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass**: The specification is written in user-focused language without technical implementation details. All descriptions focus on "what" the system must do, not "how" it will be implemented.

✅ **Pass**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with concrete, detailed content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification. All requirements use reasonable defaults based on physics simulation domain knowledge.

✅ **Pass**: All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each uses clear MUST statements with specific capabilities.

✅ **Pass**: All 8 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, frame rate, percentage variation, etc.) and are technology-agnostic.

✅ **Pass**: Edge cases identified include parameter validation, numerical stability, concurrent actions, and browser resize scenarios.

✅ **Pass**: Scope is well-bounded to a single-page physics simulation. Assumptions section explicitly documents constraints (ideal spring, no damping, massless spring, SI units, etc.).

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Functional requirements map clearly to user stories.

✅ **Pass**: Four user stories cover the complete feature scope from basic simulation (P1) through advanced analytics (P4), each independently testable.

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria cover performance (SC-002, SC-003, SC-006), accuracy (SC-004), usability (SC-001, SC-007, SC-008), and correctness (SC-005).

## Notes

All validation items passed on first check. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

### Assumptions Made (documented in spec)

- Ideal spring with no damping (standard for educational physics simulations)
- Massless spring (standard simplification for basic spring-mass systems)
- Default parameters: mass = 1 kg, spring constant = 10 N/m, initial length = 1 m
- SI units throughout (kg, m, N/m, s, J, m/s, m/s²)
- Numerical integration method for physics calculations
- Scrolling graph window (e.g., last 10 seconds) for long simulations
- Visual scaling to fit display area
