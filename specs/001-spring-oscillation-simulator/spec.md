# Feature Specification: Mass-Spring Oscillation Simulator

**Feature Branch**: `001-spring-oscillation-simulator`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an application to simulate mass-spring systems. The app needs to display a spring hanging from a ceiling with a weight attached at its end. Users must be able to set parameters for the mass's weight, the spring's initial length, and its stiffness (or spring constant). The applicaiton will display 2 buttons, one to start the simulation, one to reste it. Once the user clicks on \"Start simulation\" button, the application should simulate the spring's oscillation. the application have also to display graphs: one for velocity (m/s), one for acceleration (m/s^2), one for total energy (J) and one for displacement (m)."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: When a user clicks "Start simulation", should the mass begin oscillating immediately with some initial displacement, or should it start at rest until the user provides an initial condition? → A: Start at equilibrium (rest), no motion until user adds initial displacement
- Q: When a user enters an invalid parameter value (negative or zero), how should the system provide feedback? → A: Disable "Start simulation" button with tooltip explaining why
- Q: How many seconds of data should be visible in the scrolling graph windows at any given time? → A: 15 seconds (balanced, shows multiple cycles clearly)
- Q: Should users be able to pause a running simulation and then resume it from the same state? → A: Yes, add pause/resume functionality with dedicated button
- Q: How should the four graphs be arranged visually in the application interface? → A: Displacement graph on first row with spring simulation display, then velocity/acceleration/energy graphs on second row

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Configure Spring Parameters and Start Simulation (Priority: P1)

A user wants to explore how different spring parameters affect oscillation behavior. They open the application, set the mass weight, spring constant, and initial length. When they click "Start simulation", the spring appears at rest at its equilibrium position. The user must then interact with the mass (e.g., click and drag it downward) to provide an initial displacement, which causes the spring to begin oscillating.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to configure parameters, provide initial displacement, and run the simulation, the application has no value. This story delivers the minimal viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting valid parameter values, clicking "Start simulation", dragging the mass to displace it, releasing it, and verifying that the spring animates with realistic oscillation motion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** a user enters mass = 2 kg, spring constant = 10 N/m, and initial length = 1 m, and clicks "Start simulation", **Then** the spring visual displays at rest with the mass at equilibrium position (no motion).
2. **Given** the simulation is active and the mass is at rest, **When** the user drags the mass downward by 0.5 m and releases it, **Then** the spring begins oscillating with the weight moving up and down.
3. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the user clicks "Reset", **Then** the simulation stops, the spring returns to its initial rest position, and all parameters remain at their previously set values.
4. **Given** the application is in its initial state, **When** the user does not modify any parameters and clicks "Start simulation", **Then** the simulation displays the spring at rest with default parameter values.

### User Story 2 - Pause and Resume Active Simulation (Priority: P2)

A user is observing a running simulation and wants to pause it at a specific moment to examine the current graph values or mass position more carefully. They click a "Pause" button to freeze the simulation, then click "Resume" to continue from the exact same state.

**Why this priority**: Pause/resume capability enables detailed analysis and is a common expectation for interactive simulations, but the application still provides value without it (users could reset and restart).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a simulation with initial displacement, letting it oscillate for several cycles, pausing it at an arbitrary point, verifying all motion and graph updates stop, then resuming and confirming oscillation continues seamlessly from the paused state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulation is running with the mass oscillating, **When** the user clicks "Pause", **Then** the animation stops, graphs stop updating, and the "Pause" button changes to show "Resume".
2. **Given** a simulation is paused, **When** the user clicks "Resume", **Then** the animation and graph updates continue from the exact position, velocity, and time where they were paused.
3. **Given** a simulation is paused, **When** the user clicks "Reset", **Then** the simulation stops completely and returns to the initial rest state.

### User Story 3 - View Real-Time Displacement Graph (Priority: P3)

A user wants to understand the position changes of the mass over time. While the simulation is running, they observe a graph showing displacement (in meters) plotted against time to see the oscillation pattern quantitatively.

**Why this priority**: Displacement is the most fundamental measurement in spring oscillation and directly corresponds to what the user sees visually. It provides the bridge between visual observation and quantitative analysis.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a simulation and verifying that a displacement graph updates in real-time, showing a sinusoidal wave pattern that matches the visual oscillation period and amplitude.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the mass oscillates, **Then** the displacement graph displays a continuous curve showing position changes over time with appropriate axis labels (time in seconds, displacement in meters).
2. **Given** the spring has completed several oscillations, **When** the user observes the displacement graph, **Then** the graph shows a repeating sinusoidal pattern with consistent amplitude and period.

---

### User Story 4 - View Real-Time Velocity and Acceleration Graphs (Priority: P4)

A user wants to analyze the dynamics of the oscillation in detail. They observe velocity and acceleration graphs alongside the displacement graph to understand how these derived quantities change throughout the oscillation cycle.

**Why this priority**: Velocity and acceleration provide deeper physics insights but are less immediately intuitive than displacement. They enhance understanding but are not essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a simulation and verifying that velocity and acceleration graphs update in real-time, with velocity showing maximum values at equilibrium and acceleration showing maximum values at extremes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the mass passes through the equilibrium position, **Then** the velocity graph shows a maximum (peak) value while the acceleration graph shows zero.
2. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the mass reaches maximum displacement (amplitude), **Then** the velocity graph shows zero while the acceleration graph shows a maximum value.
3. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the user observes all three graphs (displacement, velocity, acceleration), **Then** the phase relationships are correct: velocity leads displacement by 90°, and acceleration leads displacement by 180°.

---

### User Story 5 - View Real-Time Energy Graph (Priority: P5)

A user wants to verify energy conservation principles. They observe a total energy graph that should remain constant throughout the simulation, demonstrating that mechanical energy is conserved in an ideal spring system.

**Why this priority**: Energy analysis is important for physics education and validation, but it's an advanced feature that builds on the other graphs. Users can understand spring motion without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a simulation and verifying that the total energy graph displays a horizontal line (constant value) throughout the oscillation, calculated as the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** the mass oscillates through multiple cycles, **Then** the total energy graph shows a constant horizontal line with minimal variation (ideally zero in a perfect simulation).
2. **Given** different parameter configurations are tested, **When** each simulation runs, **Then** each displays a different constant total energy value proportional to the amplitude squared and spring constant.

- What happens when a user enters extremely large values that might cause numerical instability in the simulation?
- What happens when a user clicks "Start simulation" while a simulation is already running?
- How does the system handle rapid repeated clicks on "Start simulation" and "Reset" buttons?
- What happens if the browser window is resized during an active simulation?

## Assumptions

- The simulation assumes an ideal spring with no damping (friction or air resistance), allowing for perpetual oscillation and perfect energy conservation.
- The spring is assumed to be massless, with all mass concentrated in the attached weight.
- Parameter input controls accept numeric values; the system assumes standard SI units (kg, m, N/m) without unit conversion.
- Default parameter values are set to demonstrate clear oscillation: mass = 1 kg, spring constant = 10 N/m, initial length = 1 m (these are reasonable educational defaults).
- The simulation uses a fixed time step numerical integration method (such as Euler or Runge-Kutta) for calculating motion.
- Graphs display a scrolling window showing the most recent 15 seconds of data to maintain readability during long simulations while providing sufficient context to observe multiple oscillation cycles.
- The visual spring representation scales appropriately to fit the display area regardless of the configured initial length parameter.
